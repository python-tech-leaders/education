<h2>Files</h2>


ls

--- lists your files


ls -l

--- lists your files in 'long format', which contains lots of useful information, e.g. the exact size of the file, who owns the file and who has the right to look at it, and when it was last modified


ls -a 

--- lists all files, including the ones whose filenames begin in a dot, which you do not always want to see.
There are many more options, for example to list files by size, by date, recursively etc


more filename 

--- shows the first part of a file, just as much as will fit on one screen. Just hit the space bar to see more or q to quit. You can use /pattern to search for a pattern


<h2>Directories</h2>


mkdir dirname 

--- make a new directory


cd dirname

--- change directory


pwd 

--- tells you where you currently are


<h2>Finding things</h2>


ff 

--- find files anywhere on the system


grep string filename(s) 

--- looks for the string in the files
